# Discord Management Bot
A discord bot that replies to certain keywords, makes announcements in certain channels, kick/ban/unban users, uses webhooks with IFTTT to notify members of the server of youtube videos published by a channel and also let users play tic tac toe against each other. This uses Node.js along with discord.js and is hosted locally on a personal computer.
